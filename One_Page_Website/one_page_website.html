				<h2>ABOUT SERENGETI NATIONAL PARK</h2>
				<p>Serengeti National Park is a World Heritage Site
					teeming with wildlife: over 2 million ungulates, 4000 lions,
					1000 leopard, 550 cheetahs and some 500 bird species inhabit an
					area close to 15,000 square kilometers in size. Join us on a
					safari and explore the endless Serengeti plains dotted with
					trees and kopjes from which majestic lions control their kingdom;
					gaze upon the Great Migration in awe or find an elusive leopard in
					a riverine forest. Or perhaps see everything from a birdâ€™s-eye
					view and soar over the plains at sunrise during a hot air balloon
					safari. Accommodation options come in every price range - the
					sound of lions roaring at night is complimentary.</p>
