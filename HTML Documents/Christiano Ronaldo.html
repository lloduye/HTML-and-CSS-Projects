        <h1>Cristiano Ronaldo crowned the GOAT
            ahead of Messi and Pele by mathematical study</h1>
            <p> Debate over which footballer deserves the title of

        <p>Ultimately, it’s all down to personal opinion, so there is no right or wrong answer. Right?
            Well, Dr Tom Crawford, who works as a mathematician at the University of Oxford,
            has attempted to settle the GOAT debate once and for all on behalf of LiveScore.</p>
           <blockquote> “As football fans we have all grown up mesmerised by the most iconic players of our respective generations.
            However, when it comes to debating the Greatest of all Time, crowning the G.O.A.T. has been a difficult challenge,”
           <br> <br><strong> Ric Leask </strong> Marketing Director at LiveScore</blockquote>
